      <h3>Support</h3>
      <p>Lethal MC is a non-commercial server ran by poor college students, and running it isn't free. Server costs go over $10 a month,
        and we have put in many free hours developing and improving the server. You can support us by donating, playing, testing, voting, and other ways. All
        donations go towards server costs and improvements. People who consistently support will receive VIP rank.</p>

      <h3>Donate</h3>
      <p><strong>Note:</strong> This is not a one-time donation rank
        that you purchase. Lethal MC is a non-commercial server and operates under Mojang's EULA. We cannot sell abilities or access to commands. Donating to the server does not mean you will gain any advantage or items. That said, we do give advanced privileges to players who go above in their support for us. VIP's must consistently play and support in various ways. <strong>You do NOT have to donate to receive VIP rank and can earn it by going above in other ways.</strong> It is expected that players who want to be VIP's and Admins are committed enough that they consistently financially support and consistently obey our rules. We reserve the right to change your rank on our server at any time. If you would like to
        support our server, you can cover a month of our expenses below.</p>
